# Data Science Undergrad to Master

This repository store that everything I learned from [UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) and other online sources from 2019 to 2024. For me, this is more like a revision notes / cheatsheet for my future data science releated career. 
If you notice something not so clear or errors or contents that confusing to other audiences, just start a issue and let's see what we can improve on it.
Also, if there is a better way for categorisation, don't be hesitate starting a new issue! Let's make others life more easier!

### Data Structure
Data structure is a specialised format for organizing, processing retrieving and storing data. It makes human and machine have a better understanding of data storage. Specifically, it could be use for storing data, managing resources and services, data exchange, ordering and sorting, indexing, searching, scalability in a more efficient way (David & Sarah, 2021).

- [x] [Linked List](./notebooks/DS/LinkedList.ipynb)

    Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Linked list can be defined as the nodes that are randomly stored in the memory. A node in the linked list contains two parts, i.e., first is the data part and second is the address part. The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null. After array, linked list is the second most used data structure. In a linked list, every link contains a connection to another link (Java T Point).
    
    Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis (Wikipedia).
    
    Linked lists overcome the limitations of array, a linked list doesn't require a fix size, this is because the memory space a linked list is dynamic allocated. Unlike an array, linked list doesn't need extra time if we want to increase the list size. Also linked list could store various type of data instead of fixed one.
    
    **Linked list could classified into the following types:**
    - Singly-linked list
        A linked list only link in one direction, a new node also insert at the end of the linked list.
    - Doubly-linked list
        A node in linked list have two direction pointer, the headers point to the previous node and the next node. 
    - Circular singly linked list
        The last node of the list always point to the first node of the linked list.
    - Circular doubly linked list
        The last node of the list point to the first node, and each node also have a pointer link to the previous node.
    
    | **Advantages**                  | **Disadvantages**                                                                         |
    | :-----------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
    | Dynamic size data structure     | More memory usage compare to an array                                                     |
    | Easy insertion and deletion     | Traversal is not easy because it cannot be randomly accessed                              |
    | Memory consumption is efficient | Reverse traversal is hard, a double-linked list need extra space to store another pointer |
    | Easy implement                  |                                                                                           |

   
    **Time Complexity**

    | Operation | Average case time complexity | Worst case time complexity | Description                          |
    | :-------- | :--------------------------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------- |
    | Insertion | O(1)                         | O(1)                       | Insert to the end of the linked list |
    | Deletion  | O(1)                         | O(1)                       | Delect only need one operation       |
    | Search    | O(n)                         | O(n)                       | Linear search time because it requires search from the start to the end |
   
    n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
   
    **Space Complexity**
    
    | Operation | Space Complexity | 
    | :-------- | :--------------: | 
    | Insertion | O(n)             | 
    | Deletion  | O(n)             |
    | Search    | O(n)             |

#### **Concepts**
- [ ] [k-anonymity]()
- [x] [FAIR principle](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
    
    FAIR Guiding Principles of scientific data management and stewardship provide guidelines to improve the **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse** of digital assest. The principle emphasis machine actionabiilty (i.e. the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to dael with data as a result of the increase in volumne, complexity, and creation speed of data (GO FAIR).
    
    According to Go-Fair, it define the following **FAIRification process**
    
    **Findable:**
    - (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    - Data are described with rich metadata
    - Metadata clearly and explicityly include the identifier of the data they describe
    - (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
    
    **Accessible:**
    - (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
        - The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
        - The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
    - Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
    
    **Interoperable:**
    - (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation
    - (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
    - (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
    
    **Reusable:**
    - (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
        - (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
        - (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
        - (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
    
    In short, follow the FAIR principle, a dataset will contain a meaningful metadata that describes where to find the data, how to access the data, how to use the data and finally help user optimise the reuse of data.
